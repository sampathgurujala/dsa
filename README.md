# DSA Repository

This repository is dedicated to revising and strengthening core **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** concepts. It contains well-organized Java implementations for commonly used algorithms in competitive programming.

## 📁 Repository Structure

### ✅ Topological Sort
- `TopologicalSort.java` — Implements Kahn's Algorithm to return a valid course order from prerequisites.

### ✅ BST (Binary Search Tree)
- `BinarySearchTree.java` — Basic BST operations: insert, search, delete.
- `IterativeTraversals.java` — In-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals implemented iteratively.

### ✅ Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms
- `Kruskal.java` — MST using Kruskal’s algorithm with Union-Find.
- `Prims.java` — MST using Prim’s algorithm with a priority queue.

### ✅ Shortest Path
- `Dijkstra.java` — Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm using a min-heap (priority queue).

### ✅ Sorting Algorithms
- `MergeSort.java` — Divide and conquer based merge sort implementation.
- `QuickSort.java` — Quick sort implementation with pivot partitioning logic.

### ✅ String Pattern Matching Algorithms
- `KMP.java` — Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm for efficient string pattern matching.
